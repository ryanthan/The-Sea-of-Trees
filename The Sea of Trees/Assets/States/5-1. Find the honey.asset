  storyText: "Driven by your ever-growing hunger, you head off your original path
    and follow the smell.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, you stumble across a honeycomb
    hanging from a nearby tree. From what you can tell, the beautiful structure is
    chock full of sweet honey and curiously, there seem to be no bees nearby.\r However,
    as you approach the honeycomb for a taste, you hear a faint buzzing noise in
    the distance...\n\r\nWhat will you do?\r\r\n[1]: Eat the honey.\r\n[2]: Find
    something else to eat."
