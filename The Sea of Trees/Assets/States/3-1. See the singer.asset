  storyText: 'Thinking it might be a camper or forest ranger, you follow the sound
    of the voice.


    You are led to a forest clearing where the fallen trunks
    of ancient trees are strewn about the ground.


    In the center sits a shadowy
    figure, singing their melancholy melody.


    What will you do?

    [1]: Approach
    the figure and ask for help.

    [2]: Turn back and go in the opposite direction.'
