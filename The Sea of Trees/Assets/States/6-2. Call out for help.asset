  storyText: "You think to yourself: \"It is! Someone is walking around with a flashlight!
    Maybe they could help me? Or could it be someone dangerous? At this rate, I don't
    think I have any other choice...\r\" As you feel your body getting weaker by
    the second, you push aside your doubts and call out for help. Unfortunately,
    the person doesn't hear you due to the howling wind but you can't afford to give
    up yet.\r\n\r\nYou muster up the rest of your strength and call out for help
    as loud as you can. Luckily, the flashlight turns in your direction and you can
    hear loud footsteps rushing towards you.\r As the stranger heads in your direction,
    your conciousness starts to fade...\r\n\n[1] or [2]: Continue"
