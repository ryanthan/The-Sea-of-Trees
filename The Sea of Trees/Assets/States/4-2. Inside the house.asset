  storyText: "As you slowly approach the room, you accidentally kick something hard
    on the ground. As your vision adjusts to the darkness, it looks like you kicked
    an ... arm?! You frantically back away and accidentally run into something behind
    you that falls and shatters on the ground.\r\n\r\nPanicked, you take a look around
    the room to find dozens of life-sized mannequins scattered around the cabin.
    Relieved that it wasn't a real arm on the ground, you take a deep breath and
    make your way to the back room.\r\n\r\nWhat will you do?\r\r\n[1]: Calm your
    nerves and open the door to the back room.\r\n[2]: Succumb to your nerves and
    leave the house."
