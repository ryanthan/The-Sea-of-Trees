  storyText: 'You choose to ignore your hunger and continue making your way through
    the forest. As you trudge through the seemingly never-ending labyrinth of trees,
    your vision starts to blur.


    Your body starts to succumb to the hunger pains.
    Desperate for something to eat, you frantically search the surrounding foliage
    for something edible.


    Alas, your search is in vain. Doubled over in pain
    and with no signs of help anywhere nearby, you lie there, helpless and afraid...
