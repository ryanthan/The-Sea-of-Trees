  storyText: 'Desperate for water to wash off the honey, you begin to frantically
    look around the area for a river or pond.


    The faint buzzing from earlier
    suddenly becomes an earpiercing roar as a massive swarm of bees emerge from the
    trees to protect their precious honey.


    You try to get away as fast as you
    can but unfortunately, you do not get very far before being completely overwhelmed
    by the swarm.


    Unable to escape and unable to scream for help, you succumb
    to the never ending cloud of stingers...
