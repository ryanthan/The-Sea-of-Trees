  storyText: "As you continue making your way through the forest, your stomach starts
    to rumble. Since you have been so focused on getting out of the forest, you are
    much more famished than you initially thought.\r You think to yourself: \"When
    was the last time I ate? ... No good, I can't remember a thing. I need to find
    something to eat soon. Maybe there are some fruits nearby?\r\"\nAs if on cue,
    the mesmerizing smell of honey fills your nostrils. Possibly due to your hunger,
    this seems to be the sweetest, most delicious smelling honey you have ever come
    across.\r\n\r\nWhat will you do?\r\n[1]: Find the honey.\r\n[2]: Ignore the smell
    and push onward."
