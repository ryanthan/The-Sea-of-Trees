  storyText: "As you continue making your way through the forest, you hear a scream
    in the distance. Concerned for the person's safety, you run in the direction
    of the voice.\r After some time, you find an abandoned cabin.\n\nWhile you know
    that abandoned cabins in the woods are often nothing but bad news, the scream
    is definitely coming from inside.\r\n\r\nThe person screaming sounds like they
    are in a lot of pain.\r\n\r\r\nWhat will you do?\r\n[1]: Enter the cabin.\r\n[2]:
    Ignore the scream and continue on your original path."
