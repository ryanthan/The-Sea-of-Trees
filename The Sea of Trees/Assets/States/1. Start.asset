  storyText: "Disgruntled, you awake to find yourself in the middle of a dense forest
    in the dead of night.\r With no memory of how you arrived there, your main goal
    is to escape the forest.\r\n\r\nThe wind howls as it dances among the trees.\r\r\nMixed
    within the ghastly breeze is a ... voice?\r\nYou hear a faint song coming from
    deeper within the forest.\r\n\r\nShould you investigate?\r\n[1]: Go deeper into
    the forest in search of who is singing.\r\n[2]: Ignore the voice and continue
    in the opposite direction."
